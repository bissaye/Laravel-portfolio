                I am a software engineer from the National School of Post and Telecommunications (SUP'PTIC) in Yaound√©, Cameroon.<br>

                </ul>
                I have been working as a fullstack developer for almost 3 years, and I do it with a lot of love because IT and development are my passions; and that's what pushes me to learn again and again every day. <br>
